Doing LeetCode problems in Rust to get better at Rust!

*N.b.:* The types specified by the problem statements are very often not idiomatic (e.g., passing ownership when a shared/mutable reference would've sufficed or storing in a Vector a statically-known number of fields).
Because the goal here is to learn Rust, I more often than not end up modifying said types.
So don't be suprised if copying and pasting the code here into the website results in a compilation error!
